# Contributing

If you as a new contributor encounter any errors, then please create
an issue report, and you will already have made a great contribution!

If you want to tinker yourself and submit a pull request, get started by using
the following steps:

 1. `git clone git@github.com:akeeman/bumpver`
 2. `cd bumpver`
 3. `poetry install` (requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
 4. `poetry shell` (activates the venv)
 5. `pre-commit install` (installs pre-commit hooks locally to the project)
